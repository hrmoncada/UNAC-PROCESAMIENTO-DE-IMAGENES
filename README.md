# PROCESAMIENTO_DE_IMAGENES

Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods.

Types of Image Processing : There are five main types of image processing:
* Visualization - Find objects that are not visible in the image
* Recognition - Distinguish or detect objects in the image
* Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
* Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
* Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image

## Fundamental Image Processing Steps
**Image Acquisition :** Image acquisition is the first step in image processing. This step is also known as preprocessing in image processing. It involves retrieving the image from a source, usually a hardware-based source.

**Image Enhancement :** Image enhancement is the process of bringing out and highlighting certain features of interest in an image that has been obscured. This can involve changing the brightness, contrast, etc.

**Image Restoration :** Image restoration is the process of improving the appearance of an image. However, unlike image enhancement, image restoration is done using certain mathematical or probabilistic models.

**Color Image Processing :** Color image processing includes a number of color modeling techniques in a digital domain. This step has gained prominence due to the significant use of digital images over the internet.

**Wavelets and Multiresolution Processing :** Wavelets are used to represent images in various degrees of resolution. The images are subdivided into wavelets or smaller regions for data compression and for pyramidal representation.

**Compression :** Compression is a process used to reduce the storage required to save an image or the bandwidth required to transmit it. This is done particularly when the image is for use on the Internet.

**Morphological Processing :** Morphological processing is a set of processing operations for morphing images based on their shapes.

**Segmentation :** Segmentation is one of the most difficult steps of image processing. It involves partitioning an image into its constituent parts or objects. 

**Representation and Description :** After an image is segmented into regions in the segmentation process, each region is represented and described in a form suitable for further computer processing. Representation deals with the imageâ€™s characteristics and regional properties. Description deals with extracting quantitative information that helps differentiate one class of objects from the other.

**Recognition :** Recognition assigns a label to an object based on its description.
