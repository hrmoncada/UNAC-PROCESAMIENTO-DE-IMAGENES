1. CPU (Central Processing Unit): Refers to the physical chip that processes instructions. A system can have multiple CPUs.
2. Core: A core is a processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, which allows them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
3. Thread: A thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler. Many modern CPUs support simultaneous multithreading (SMT), allowing each core to handle multiple threads.

The difference between CPUs, cores, and threads is crucial for several reasons:

1. Performance Optimization: Knowing how many cores and threads your CPU has can help you optimize applications for parallel processing, improving performance for multi-threaded applications.
2. Resource Allocation: In server environments, understanding CPU architecture is essential for resource allocation to ensure efficient operation.
3. System Design: When designing or purchasing hardware, knowing these specifications helps in making informed decisions based on workload requirements.
Recommended Reading

For a deeper understanding of CPU architecture and performance, consider the following topics and resources:

1. Computer Architecture: Books like "Computer Organization and Design" by Patterson and Hennessy provide insights into how CPUs work.
2. Operating Systems: "Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne covers how operating systems manage hardware resources, including CPUs.
3. Parallel Programming: "Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP" introduces concepts of multi-threading and parallel processing.

These resources will give you a solid grounding in the terminology and its practical applications in computing.

Get the number of total core include thread

$ lscpu
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo

(base) lola:C$ echo "Threads/core: $(nproc --all)"
Threads/core: 8

(base) lola:C$ hwinfo --cpu --short 
Command 'hwinfo' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install hwinfo


Find the total threads, multiply the number of cores by the threads per core.

CPU(s):                   8
